               Drawing of maps
               ===============

General
-------

This document describes how the mainwindow of Pertergrin 
(PTGMainWindow) interacts with the three map editors of
Pertergrin: World, Town, Dungeon. In Practice more editors
could be added for special RPGs but I hope this won't be
necessary (like house/castle: Base is Dungeon).

MapDrawArea
-----------
There is a module being able to create and store maps. It is
called CWMapDrawArea. It is a custom widget for gtkmm. It uses
one or several tile sets. When you set a tile on the map you
have to define which one and from which tileset (optionally,
if undefined the current tileset is used).
This class draws the map on the screen. The map consists only
of the tiles and size information. The tiles themselves only
consists of a name and positions inside the tiles. All other
information concering the map is not stored in this class.

Editing
-------

The user can edit a region of the map. This region can
be completely deleted, copied and pasted.

Integration
-----------

As there is a lot of abstraction inside the program to be
considered even the dungeon and town editor can be optional
components only available with certain game types. So the
mainwindow and the world only consists of one map (types).
The other maps and their content have to be done through
the abilities model. To make the thing a bit easier we
define a map module doing the work of managing the map
content and the draw content for us. When the user switches
to another map type the module gets activated.

Module Town
-----------

The town module consists like the mainwindow of a map and
the map being drawn on the screen.
