                   Module Integration
                   ==================

General
-------
This documents describes how the modules (internal one as well
as additional external) are integrated into the Pertegrin.
Typical modules are town, dungeon, equipment, npc editor.

Main Window
-----------
The main window is the interface to the UI parts of the
modules. All the dialogs or forms accessible by the menu 
are created and shown using the main window. Forms are 
usually dockable and do not need to be handled by the user
at once. 

Every UI-module has to provide certain informations 
(configuration): 
Name
Description
UI-Type (like dialog, form)
Name of Glade file
PTG-Type (f.e. TOWN_BASE, TOWN_EXTENSION) 
State availability (bool)
Provided methods

Extension modules can be defined by the user (ptgeditor 
configuration). As extension modules are optional the
ptgeditor checks the availability of a extension module.

If the modules has state availability the state can
be shown somewhere in the ptgeditor (to be defined closer)

Modules can use other modules as well but have to look
for themselves if the needed module is available.

App Core
--------
The world type defines features a certain role playing game
has. This feature list has influence on the Pertergrin user
interface. After the world is created all features not 
supported are greyed out or removed at the user interface.

To offer this flexibility the types are not defined in code
but by files being found in the modules directory. The
modules hierarchy looks like this:
- world: Modules for different world types
- map: Modules for creating maps (like dungeons, towns)
- equipment: editors for equipment
- npc: editors for NPCs
- ...

The world modules basically define which editing abilities
are available for the world. Such a module needs to provide
the following information (configuration):
Name (shown in the "New World" dialog)
Description


Example
-------
Name: Town_Base
Description: Base dialog for Town options
UI-Type: Dialog
Name of glade file: Town_Base.glade
PTG_Type: TOWN_BASE
State availability: No
Provided Methods: getOptions, setOptions
