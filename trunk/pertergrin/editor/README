                   Pertergrin - A RPG system
                   =========================

Pertergrin a fantasy role playing game. As such it has certain known 
features of this type of games. It has a freely invented historic 
background. The player (i.e. YOU) plays the role of a hero.
The computer plays the role of the master which controls the game.

Pertergrin is also a fantasy role playing game system. As such you do 
not only play one game (or sequels) but you can create your
own games inside Pertergrin. It has the potential to break the historic
restriction (so you could theoretically invent a science fiction role
playing game) but this is outside the direct focus of the authors.

Pertergrin features an Editor where you can change the Pertergrin World.
You can create the world, buildings, towns, NPCs, and other objects.

Pertergrin is an acronym for Per Terram Grinare.
Pertergrin is a game developed for Amiga (NG) and Linux.

To install this game you need to have gtk 1.2 or higher installed
for the editor as well as SDL for the game client. Most data is saved
in a database. Pertergrin uses PostgreSQL 7.1 or higher which need to
be installed as well. An install script is available which creates
the database for you and you can optionally insert the "demo" game
Pertergrin (recommanded).

To play the game you first need to load the world (if you do not want
to play the default Pertergrin world), then load or create your
character(s). You have even more loading options but these can be
read in the Pertergrin manual in the doc directory.

The editor should be quite straight forward to use. If you start it
it first looks in the database for a game and loads it if it is
available. It creates a new game if none if available. You have the
option to export the whole game (which is recommanded for backups).
You should know that you can protect certain areas of the game and
this feature is also used by the Pertergrin world so that there is
a common standard for certain towns and areas. When you study the
manual you will certainly find out how to access these areas as well.

The current stable or development version of the game can be found on
http://pertergrin.berlios.de. If you prefer to live on the bleeding
edge you can access the latest code from CVS. If you want to actively
participate on the development just ask one of the developer or on
the Pertergrin development mailing list.
