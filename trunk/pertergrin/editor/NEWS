V0.1
The first demo version of the editor is being ported to gtk2
using libglademm2 (thus requiring gtkmm2). On my distribution
I had to install a recent libsigc++ (1.2), and the above libs
manually. Remember that this is only a first prototype, as soon
as it evolves you could qualify it as a pre-alpha version.

V0.0

A first demo version of the editor should be available by now.
You cannot save a game but you should get a feeling how the
editor will look like. The only thing I would qualify as alpha
is the mapeditor widget which is in the editor/mapeditwidget
directory and which will somewhen released seperately.
