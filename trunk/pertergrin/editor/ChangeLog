        - Started port to gtk2, using libglademm2
        - Switched completely to C++ (GUI will be in C++ as well)
        - libsigc++1.2 (development branch), gtkmm2 (dito), libglademm2 (dito)
        - libgtk2, libglib2, libglade2, and glade-2 editor are required
        - anjuta as development editor is recommanded
        - reworked directory structure of editor
        - mapeditwidget now in main directory (so it can be easily
          removed from the project).
13 May 2001 - Reinhard Katzmann <reinhard@suamor.de>
	- Fixed a lot of bugs in editor/mapeditwiget/mapeditclass.c
	- Added configure scripts, docs and Makefile(s) for the editor
	  and the mapeditclass (including the testmapedit demo).
	- Added a prototype for the editor. Some things are todo until
	  it can be used as to draw some maps: editor/ptgeditor
	- Added my graphics (ptg_landscape.png) which can be used for 
	  drawing.
