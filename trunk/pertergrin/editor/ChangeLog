	- Concept: Dynamic GUI (UI modules)
	- Concept: Integration of modules
	- Concept: map drawing
	- Resolve build problems with current automake (Mandrake 10)
	- It is no longer allowed to use SOURCES from subdirectories
	  -> Create static libraries for gui and kernel
	- Makefile.am: Copy ptgeditor to main directory (this can lead
	  to build problems on especially older system! Please report)
	- New menu item: Change world (only active after creating a world)
	- Fix ptgtypes.h: vector< vector<T> > -> vector<T> (linear)
	- Adapt world.cc to the ptgtypes.h change
	- mainwindow.cc: Read Options from worlddialog
	- mainwindow.cc: Use moApp to allocate memory for the world
	- mainwindow.cc: New method for menu item "Change World"
	- worlddialog.cc: Get widgets from world dialog
	- worlddialog.cc: Implemented set/getOptions method

	- Start port to GTK2
	- Checked in the current SQL database from October 2002 (sorry)
	- Started switch to CPP / gtkmm / libglademm based PTG Editor
05 October 2002 - Reinhard Katzmann <reinhard@suamor.de>
        - Started port to gtk2, using libglademm2
        - Switched completely to C++ (GUI will be in C++ as well)
        - libsigc++1.2 (development branch), gtkmm2 (dito), libglademm2 (dito)
        - libgtk2, libglib2, libglade2, and glade-2 editor are required
        - anjuta as development editor is recommanded
        - reworked directory structure of editor
        - mapeditwidget now in main directory (so it can be easily
          removed from the project).
13 May 2001 - Reinhard Katzmann <reinhard@suamor.de>
	- Fixed a lot of bugs in editor/mapeditwiget/mapeditclass.c
	- Added configure scripts, docs and Makefile(s) for the editor
	  and the mapeditclass (including the testmapedit demo).
	- Added a prototype for the editor. Some things are todo until
	  it can be used as to draw some maps: editor/ptgeditor
	- Added my graphics (ptg_landscape.png) which can be used for 
	  drawing.
