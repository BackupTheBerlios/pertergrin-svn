Installation instructions (cvs)
===============================

Remember the dependencies of the editor: libglademm-2/gtkmm-2!

See the berlios project page how to really checkout from cvs.

Here it goes:
- Check out pertergrin editor from cvs
- type ./autgen.sh
(you can add optional arguments for configure already here)
- type make

If there are any problems, please report them to the
pertergrin development list.

You can now start the program with ./ptgeditor.
The pathes in the program require that the glade files are
in the gui directory which has to be in the same directory
as the executable. This will of course change for the release.

Anjuta
======

One word of warning: If you use anjuta, do not change the
project flags for overwriting configure.in / Makefile.am
or else you will break everything (anjuta does officially
only support the "src" directory and not "./" as src and
it has a bug that it adds the src directory twice to
configure.in). This also means that you need to change
configure.in if you add other directories containing an=20
own Makefile.am (like f.e. a doc directory).

anjuta version: 1.1.97
