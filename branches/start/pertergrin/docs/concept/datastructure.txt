2) Modularity

With the help of hooks the game can be expanded as well as the editor.
In the game the hooks are related to the Tasks. Most things in the
editor are defined through the data in the data basis (even the modules
for the game), so what to expand here ? (Even SciFi RPG with several
geographies (i.e. worlds, moons, spheres etc. is thinkable).
