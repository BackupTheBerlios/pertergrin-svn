13 May 2001 - Reinhard Katzmann <reinhard@suamor.de>
	- Fixed a lot of bugs in editor/mapeditwiget/mapeditclass.c
	- Added configure scripts, docs and Makefile(s) for the editor
	  and the mapeditclass (including the testmapedit demo).
	- Added a prototype for the editor. Some things are todo until
	  it can be used as to draw some maps: editor/ptgeditor
	- Added my graphics (ptg_landscape.png) which can be used for 
	  drawing.
